          1. What is Cybersecurity?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-7 mb-6">
          Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting networks, systems,
          and data from digital attacks. These attacks often aim to access,
          steal, or destroy sensitive information. Common threats include
          malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, and more.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-3">
          2. Why is Cybersecurity Important?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-7 mb-6">
          As our lives become more connected, the importance of securing
          personal data has never been greater. A cyberattack can result in
          significant financial losses, identity theft, and damage to personal
          and professional reputations. Businesses and governments are also
          targeted, leading to devastating breaches of critical infrastructure
          and information.

          3. Tips for Protecting Personal Information
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-7 mb-6">
          Protecting your personal information requires vigilance. Here are some
          key steps to take:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Create unique, complex
            passwords for each of your online accounts, and avoid using the same
            password across multiple platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Add an
            extra layer of security by enabling 2FA on your accounts, requiring
            both a password and a secondary verification method.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regularly update your
            operating system, applications, and antivirus software to protect
            against the latest security vulnerabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Beware of Phishing:</strong> Be cautious when opening
            emails, clicking on links, or downloading attachments from unknown
            sources.
          </li>
        </ul>

          4. Best Practices for Safe Online Behavior
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-7 mb-6">
          Adopting safe online practices is crucial to preventing cyber threats.
          Here are some best practices to follow:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Regular Backups:</strong> Regularly back up important files
            to an external drive or a secure cloud service to minimize the
            impact of data loss from ransomware attacks or system crashes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Wi-Fi Networks:</strong> Use strong encryption for
            your home Wi-Fi network and avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive
            activities like online banking or shopping.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor Account Activity:</strong> Keep an eye on your bank
            and credit card statements for any suspicious or unauthorized
            transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Educate Yourself:</strong> Stay informed about the latest
            cybersecurity threats and learn how to identify and avoid them.
          </li>
